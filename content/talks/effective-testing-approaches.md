title: Effective Testing Approaches for your Application
description: Unit, component, integration, end-to-end-- there are many types of testing you can use when developing and releasing an application. You may have also heard of the testing pyramid, trophy, and even crab, which all demonstrate approaches for prioritizing test types. How do you decide where to focus your time and resources to get the most impact? When you have limited time and a tight release schedule, testing can feel like a burden if it doesn't give you the confidence and results you expect. In this talk, we'll define the different types of testing and cover their use cases, as well as provide some guidelines for deciding which approach to use for your application. Refactor.Tech 2021.
